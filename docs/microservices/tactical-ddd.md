# Designing microservices: Tactical DDD

Domain driven design (DDD) has two distinct phases, strategic and tactical. In strategic DDD, you are defining the large-scale structure of the system. Tactical DDD provides a set of design patterns that you can use to create the domain model. In this section, we use these patterns to identify microservice boundaries in the Drone Delivery application.

During the strategic phase of DDD, you are mapping out the business domain, defining bounded contexts for your domain models, and developing a ubiquitous language. Tactical DDD is when you define your domain models with more precision. The tactical patterns are applied within a single bounded context. In a microservices architecture, we are particularly interested in the entity and aggregate patterns. Applying these patterns will help us to identify natural boundaries for the services in our application. As a general principle, a microservice should be no smaller than an aggregate, and no larger than a bounded context. First, we'll review the tactical patterns, then we'll apply them to the Shipping bounded context in the drone delivery application.

> This section is not meant to show a complete, comprehensive domain analysis. We have deliberately kept the example brief. However, it illustrates the overall process.  

## Overview of the tactical patterns

If you are already familiar with DDD, you can skip this section. The patterns are described in more detail in *Domain Driven Design* by Eric Evans (see chapters 5 &ndash; 6), and *Implementing Domain-Driven Design* by Vaughn Vernon. This section is only a summary of the patterns.

**Entities**. An entity is an object with a unique identity that persists over time. For example, in a banking application, customers and accounts would be entities. 

- An entity has a unique identifier in the system, which can be used to look up or retrieve the entity. That doesn't mean the identifier is necessarily exposed to users. It could be a GUID or a primary key in a database. The identifier might be a composite key, especially for child entities.
- An identity may span multiple bounded contexts, and may endure beyond the lifetime of the application. For example, bank account numbers or government-issued IDs are not tied to the lifetime of a particular application.
- The attributes of an entity may change over time. For example, a person's name or address might change, but they are still the same person. 
- An entity can hold references to other entities.
 
**Value objects**. A value object has no identity. It is defined only by the values of its attributes. Value objects are also immutable. To update a value object, you always create a new instance to replace the old one. Value objects can have methods that encapsulate domain logic, but those methods should have no side-effects on the object's state. Typical examples of value objects include colors, dates and times, and currency values. 

**Aggregates**. An aggregate defines a consistency boundary around one or more entities. Exactly one entity in an aggregate is the root. Lookup is done using the root entity's identifier. Any other entities in the aggregate are children of the root, and are referenced by following pointers from the root. 

The purpose of an aggregate is to model transactional invariants. Things in the real world have complex webs of relationships. Customers create orders, orders contain products, products have suppliers, and so on. If the application modifies several related objects, how does it guarantee consistency? How do we keep track of invariants and enforce them?  

Traditional applications have often used database transactions to enforce consistency. In a distributed application, however, that's often not be feasible. A single business transaction may span multiple data stores, or may be long running, or may involve third-party services. Ultimately it's up to the application, not the data layer, to enforce the invariants required for the domain. 

> [!NOTE]
> It's actually common for an aggregate to consist of a single entity, with no child entities. Even so, the distinction between aggregates and entities is still important. An aggregate enforces transactional semantics, while an entity might not.

**Domain and application services**. In DDD terminology, a service is an object that implements some logic without holding any state. Evans distinguishes between *domain services*, which encapsulate domain logic, and *application services*, which provide technical functionality, such as user authentication or sending an SMS message. Domain services are often used to model behavior that spans multiple entities. 

> [!NOTE]
> The term *service* is overloaded in computer science. The definition here is not directly related to microservices.

**Domain events**. Domain events can be used to notify other parts of the system when something happens. As the name signifies, domain events should model things that are meaningful in terms of the domain, not the implementation details. For example, "Record inserted in table" is not a domain event. "Delivery cancelled" is a domain event. Domain events are especially relevant in a microservices architecture, where services are distributed and do not share data stores. The chapter [Interservice communication](./interservice-communication.md) looks at asynchronous messaging in microservices.
 
There are a few other DDD patterns not listed here, including factories, repositories, and modules. These can be useful patterns within a microservice, but are less relevant for designing service boundaries.

## Define entities and aggregates

We start with the scenarios that the Shipping bounded context must handle.

- A business (the sender) can schedule a drone to deliver a package to a customer (the receiver). Alternatively, a user can request a drone to pick up goods from a business that is registered with the drone delivery service. 
- The sender generates a tag (barcode or RFID) to put on the package. 
- A drone will pick up and deliver a package from the source location to the destination location.
- When a user schedules a delivery, the system provides an ETA based on route information, weather conditions, historical data, and so forth. 
- When the drone is in flight, the sender and the receiver can track the current location and the latest ETA. 
- Until a drone has picked up the package, the user can cancel a delivery.
- When the delivery is complete, the sender and the receiver are notified.
- The sender can request delivery confirmation from the user, in the form of a signature or finger print.
- A user can look up the history of a completed delivery.

From these scenarios, the development team identified the following **entities**.

- Delivery
- Package
- Drone
- Account
- Confirmation
- Notification
- Tag

Of these, Delivery, Package, Drone, and Account are **aggregates**. Tag, Confirmation, and Notification are associated with Delivery entities. The **value objects** in this design include Location, ETA, PackageWeight, and PackageSize. 

To illustrate, here is a UML diagram of the Delivery aggregate. Notice that it holds references to other aggregates, including Account, Package, and Drone.

![](./images/delivery-entity.png)

The development team also identified an important piece of functionality that doesn't fit neatly into any of the entities or aggregates. Some part of the system must coordinate all of the steps involved in scheduling or updating a delivery. We'll go into this topic in more detail (see [Ingestion and workflow](./ingestion-workflow.md)), but to summarize, the development team decides to implement two **domain services**:

- A *Scheduler* that coordinates the steps.
- A *Supervisor* that monitors the status of each step, to detect whether any steps have failed or timed out.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a variation of the [Scheduler Agent Supervisor pattern](../patterns/scheduler-agent-supervisor.md).

## Identify microservices

What is the right size for a microservice? "Not too big and not too small" &mdash; while that's certainly a correct answer, it's not very helpful in practice. We believe that domain-driven design, if you take the time to follow the process, can get you most of the way to a set of well-designed microservices.

1. Start with a bounded context. In general, the functionality in a microservice shouldn't span more than one bounded context. By definition, a bounded context marks the boundary of a particular domain model. If you find that a microservice needs to mix different domain models together, that's an indicator that you may need to go back and refine your domain analysis.

2. Next, look at the aggregates in your domain model. There should be one or more aggregates that have substantial domain logic. (If not, you may need to revisit your domain model.) These aggregates are candidates for microservices. A well-designed aggregate exhibits many of the characteristics of a well-designed microservice:

    - Aggregates are derived from business requirements, rather than technical concerns such as "data access" or "messaging".  
    - An aggregate should have high functional cohesion.
    - Boundaries *across* aggregates should be loosely coupled. 
    - An aggregate is a boundary of persistence.

3. Domain services are also good candidates for microservices. Domain services are stateless operations across multiple aggregates. A typical example is a workflow that involves several microservices, so the system needs something that coordinates the workflow. We'll see an example of this in the Drone Delivery application.

4. Finally, consider non-functional requirements. Look at factors such as team size, data types, technologies used, scalability requirements, availability requirements, and security requirements. These factors may lead you to further decompose a microservice into two or more smaller services, or do the opposite and combine several microservices into one. 

4. Once you have identified the microservices in your application, validate your design against the following criteria.

    - Each service has a single responsibility.
    - There are no chatty calls between services. If splitting functionality into two services causes them to be overly chatty, it may be a symptom that these functions belong in the same service.
    - Each service is small enough that it can be built by a small team working independently. A team for a single service should probably not be more than a dozen people (the "two-pizza rule").
    - You haven't created inter-dependencies that will require services to be deployed in lock-step. It should always be possible to deploy a service without redeploying any other services.
    - Services are not tightly coupled, and can evolve independently.
    - Your service boundaries will not create problems with data consistency or integrity. Microservices maintain their own data stores, and sometimes it's important to maintain data consistency by putting functionality into a single microservice. That said, consider whether you really need strong consistency. There are strategies for addressing eventual consistency in a distributed system, and the benefits of decomposing services often outweigh the costs of eventual consistency.

Above all, it's important to be pragmatic, and remember that domain-driven design is an iterative process. When in doubt, start with more coarse-grained microservices. Splitting a microservice into two smaller services is a easier than refactoring functionality across several existing microservices.
    
## Drone Delivery: Defining the microservices

Recall that the development team had identified the following aggregates: Delivery, Package, Drone, and Account. The first two are part of the Shipping bounded context, while Drone and Account belong to other bounded contexts.

- Delivery and Package are obvious candidates for microservices. 

- The Scheduler and Supervisor are both stateless domain services. They need to coordinate other microservices, so it makes sense to implement them as separate microservices. 

- Drone and Account are interesting because they reside in external bounded contexts. Another option is to call directly into those external contexts. Another option is to create Drone and Account microservices that mediate between the Shipping bounded context and the other contexts. These microservices might expose APIs or data schemas that are more suited to the Shipping context. The other bounded contexts are beyond the scope of this guidance, so we'll treat Done and Account as "placeholders" whose implementation is yet to be determined. But here are some factors that you might consider in this situation:

    - What is the network overhead of calling directly into the other bounded context? 
    
    - Is the data schema for the other bounded context suitable for this context?
     
    - Is the bounded context a legacy system? If so, you might want to create a mediator service that acts as an [anti-corruption layer](../patterns/anti-corruption-layer.md).
     
    - What is the team structure? Is it easy to communicate with the team that's responsible for the other bounded context? If not, creating a mediator service can help to mitigate the cost of cross-team communication.
     
So far, we've haven't considered any non-functional requirements. Thinking about the application's throughput requirements, the development team decides to create a separate Ingestion microservice that is responsible for ingesting client requests. This microservice will implement [load leveling](../patterns/queue-based-load-leveling.md) by putting incoming requests into a buffer for processing. The Scheduler will read the requests from the buffer and execute the workflow.

The following diagram shows the design at this point:

## Choosing a compute option

The term *compute* refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on. The first high-level decision is choosing between an orchestrator or a serverless architecture. With an orchestrator, services run on nodes (VMs) and the orchestrator acts as a control plane. The orchestrator provides functionality such as service discovery, load balancing, configuration, scheduling (placing services on nodes), health monitoring, restarting unhealthy services, network routing, scaling, and so on. With a serverless architecture, you don't manage the VMs or the virtual network infrastructure. Instead, you deploy code and the hosting service handles putting that code onto a VM and executing it. This approach tends to favor small granular functions, that are coordinated by applying event-based triggers to functions. For example, putting a message onto a queue may trigger a function that reads from the queue.

Options for using an orchestrator in Azure include:

- Azure Container Service (ACS). ACS is an SLA-backed Azure service that lets you deploy a production-ready Kubernetes, DC/OS, or Docker Swarm cluster.
- [ACS Engine][acs-engine]. ACS Engine is an open-source tool that generates Azure Resource Manager (RM) templates for Kubernetes, DC/OS, or Docker Swarm clusters. Unlike ACS, ACS Engine is not a hosted Azure service, and does not offer an SLA. However, it enables some advanced configuration options that are not currently available in ACS. For more information, see [Container Service frequently asked questions][acs-faq].
- AKS (Azure Container Service). AKS is a managed Kubernetes service. AKS provisions Kubernetes and exposes the Kubernetes API endpoints, but hosts and manages the Kubernetes control plane, performing automated upgrades, automated patching, autoscaling, and other management tasks. You can think of AKS as being "Kubernetes APIs as a service." At the time of writing, AKS is still in preview. However, it's expected that AKS will become the preferred way to run Kubernetes in Azure.
- Service Fabric. Service Fabric orchestrates services that can run as containers, binary executables, or as Reliable Services. Reliable Services is a light-weight framework for writing services that integrate with the Service Fabric platform.

[Azure Functions][functions] provides a serverless compute service. It supports a variety of triggers, including HTTP request, Service Bus queue, and Event Hubs events. For a complete list, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts][functions-triggers]. Also consider [Azure Event Grid][event-grid], which is a managed event routing service in Azure. Although this guide is focused on microservices deployed in Kubernetes, we did implement one of our microservices as an Azure Function. 

We implemented all but one of these microservices as Docker container images running in Kubernetes. The only exception is the Delivery History service, which is implemented using Azure Functions. We chose Functions for this service because it’s an event-driven workload that uses a trigger to save events to a data store, along with a very simple HTTP endpoint for querying. Also, it's relatively isolated from the other services. It doesn't run as part of the main workflow, so running outside of the cluster won't affect the end-to-end latency of user-initiated operations.
